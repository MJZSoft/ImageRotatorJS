# ImageRotatorJS
This JavaScript library models image rotating feature of Flash with pure JavaScript code. 

Here is a snapshot of a sample output of the library. 

![Sample Output of the library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjza/ImageRotatorJS/master/output.PNG)

Long time ago (in 2012) I visited a website with the following address:

www.bishopimage.com/index.html

They had a very beautiful image rotator inside of their website as a banner. Currently, they changed the website design and if you go to the above address mostly you cannot visit the image rotator that I saw. Thus, I made a video from their website which you can find it at the following address:

Anyway if you were lucky you can visit the banner itself in the following address:

http://www.bishopimage.com/banner.swf

This was a pretty good encouragement for me to create a pure JavaScript library that does the same work. ImageRotaterJS is a pure lightweight JavaScript library that helps you to create beautiful banners for your website.  

The source of the images that were used inside of the above picture is http://bishop.digital/ and we used the same images as they had used in their flash file to make it comparable. We tried to get a permission from them for keeping the images inside of the img folder of this project but we have not yet received any answer. Thus we removed them and we are still waiting for any kind of answer for confirming or rejecting the use of their images inside of our live demo.

You can easily find the current version minified file in the following address:

If you need to know how to use the library just clone it and open the index.html file with a browser.
